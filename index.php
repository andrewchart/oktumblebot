/* Your tweets are shit. */
/* Follow me to the graveyard */
/* Now, let's go find some boring tweets */
//
// 
//






//
// Ahhh, come on!
// No need to be insulted
// I *love* that you are allowed to express yourself on the web
// 		It's /great/ that you got that off your chest
// 			No - really - I'm sure it was very cathartic for you
//
// If a tweet falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it...
// ..
// .. does it make a sound?
// 
// .. well, no probably not.. I've got to go now and find some more
//
// 
//
// If it makes you feel any better, this author's tweets... they don't get much love either!
