#OK Tumblebot
#### Your tweets are shit. Follow me to the graveyard.
_Now, let's go find some boring tweets_



1. Randomly gather public tweets and select a small number to pick on
	* Look for tweets a few days old..
	* That have no engagement (likes, retweets or replies)..
	* We're being rude in English, so let's be fair and seek English language tweets
	* Take reasonable steps to ensure users have human feelings
	* Pick on people who have good followings!
	* Harvest tweets in a database

2. Somewhat randomly decide what to do with the tweet
	* Like it								// A tumbleweed liked your tweet
	* Retweet it							// A tumbleweed retweeted your tweet
	* Retweet it with a sarky comment		// @YOU _BOoOoOORING!_
	* Follow the user						// A tumbleweed followed you
	* (Any combination of the above)
	
3. Add the tweet to a database table (processing queue)
	
4. Ocassionally tweet an interim botty comment
	* Anything that a tumbleweed might say (in the absence of anybody to listen to it)
	
5. Set up random-interval cron jobs to process the tweet queue
	* Check that the tweets still have no engagement at point of insult
	
6. Track users who persistently post tweets with no engagement
	* Periodically remind them that no-one is listening

7. Enable manual management and input of tweet IDs
	* For picking on friends and celebrities
